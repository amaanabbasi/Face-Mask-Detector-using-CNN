# Face-Mask-Detector-using-CNN
, a face mask detection model has been introduced to build using Convolutional Neural Network by Deep Learning And Machine Learning techniques. The proposed model can be used for surveillance via cameras to fight with COVID-19 by detecting and classifying between people not wearing masks and people wearing masks, which would reduce human interaction and human effort to a great extent. Deep Learning Technique is used for feature extraction by Deep Convolutional Neural Network implemented with some libraries as Keras, Tensorflow, and OpenCV. The model is trained and then Validated to achieve the highest accuracy, and two different Graphs have been plotted for Training and Validation Loss and for the Training And Validation Accuracy. A new set of data have also been used to make predictions and train This trained model is also used to make predictions on a new set of data that can be uploaded by the user. This model is also used to detect face mask on video streams as well
